Ordinary differential equations can be solved algebraically by using Laplace transform. The differential equation can be converted into an algebraic equation by taking the Laplace transform of both sides of the equation. The initial conditions would be taken into account in the conversion. The transformed equation can be solved, and then inverse Laplace transform can be used to obtain the solution.
