An agent that plans ahead. Considers a sequence of actions that form a path to a goal state. Uses atomic representation.

### Searching

The computational process undertaken by a problem-solving agent.

## Process

### Goal formulation

Goals organize behavior by limiting the
objectives and hence the actions to be considered.

### Problem formulation

The agent devises a description of
the states and actions necessary to reach the goal.

### Search

Before taking any action in the real world, the agent
simulates sequences of actions in its model, searching until it
finds a sequence of actions that reaches the goal (solution).

### Execution
The agent can now execute the actions in the
solution, one at a time.
