The capacity to do work or the ability to cause changes.

Total energy is denoted by $E$.

```math
E = U + \frac{1}{2}mC^2 + mgz
```

Here:
- $U$ - internal energy
- $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ - kinetic energy of the system.
- $mgz$ is the potential energy of the system.

## Microscopic energy

Refers to the energy possessed by individual particles or molecules within a system. Associated with the motion and interactions of these particles at the atomic and molecular level. Aka. internal energy. Denoted by $U$. $ $

## Macroscopic energy

Refers to the energy associated with the bulk properties of a system. Such as its temperature, pressure, and volume. It is the energy that can be measured and observed at the macroscopic scale.

## Heat & Work

Has only meaning in transitions. Can be identified only when crossing the system boundary.

Called path functions as they depends on the path taken.
