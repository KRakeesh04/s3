## Definitions

AI is concerned with understanding and building intelligent entities. Machines that can compute how to act effectively and safely in a wide range of novel situations. 

- Systems that think like humans
- Systems that think rationally
- Systems that act like humans
- Systems that act rationally

## Turing Test

Proposed by Alan Turing in 1950. A method for determining whether a machine exhibits intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human.

A human evaluator interacts with both a machine and a human through a text-based interface, without knowing which is which. If the evaluator cannot reliably distinguish the machine from the human based on their responses, the machine is said to have passed the test.

Pitfalls:
- Mimicking human behavior doesn't imply intelligence.
- Human intelligence is not the only form of intelligence.
- Subjective and can be influenced by the evaluator's biases.
- Does not measure the machine's ability to learn or adapt.
- Does not measure the machine's ability to reason or make decisions.

## Major components of AI

- Natural language processing to communicate in a human language
- Knowledge representation to store what it knows
- Automated reasoning to answer questions and draw new conclusions
- Machine learning to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns
- Computer vision to understand and interpret visual information
- Robotics to interact with the physical world
