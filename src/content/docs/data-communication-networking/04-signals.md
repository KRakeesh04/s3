Used to transmit data via a medium, such as cables and air. Generated by changing strength of a form of energy. Here frequency of a signal is also measured in _cycles per second_.

## Types
### Analog

Continuously varying.

### Digital

Discrete. Can take any number of discrete values, not to be confused with binary.

## Terminology

### Bandwidth

For analog signals, the range of frequencies that a medium is capable of handling.

For digital signals, the maximum number of bits that can be transmitted over a medium.

### Baud rate
Number of signal changes per second.

### Data rate

Number of bits tranmitted per second. Measured in bits per second.

```math
\text{Data rate} = \text{Baud rate} \times \text{Bits per symbol}
```

Data rate can be increased by increasing the number of signal components, to some extent.

### Sampling

Converting an analog signal to digital by observing the signal at regular intervals.

### Sampling rate

Number of samples taken per second. Must be equal to or higher than baud rate.

### Signal to Noise Ratio

Aka. SNR. Ratio between signal power and the noise power. Measured in dB.

```math
\text{SNR} = 10 \log_{10} \left(\frac{S}{N}\right)
```

High SNR is desirable.

## Theorems
### Nyquist theorem

**If** the highest frequency a medium can transmit is $f$, **then** a receiver is able to completely reconstruct the signal by sampling it at $2f$, assuming the channel is noiseless.

### Shanon's theorem

Maximum data rate of a medium is related to both the maximum frequency the medium can handle and SNR.

```math
\text{data rate} = \text{bandwidth} \times \log_2 \left( 1 + \frac{S}{N} \right)
```
