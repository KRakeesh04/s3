The process of applying a signal onto a carrier signal.

### Carrier signal

A high-frequency continuous signal. Usually sine wave is used. Enables efficient long distance data transmission


### Modulation rate

Rate at which the signal level is changed. Measured in bauds or signal elements per second.

### Mark

A signal element that represents a binary 1.

### Space

A signal element that represents a binary 0.

## Modulation Algorithms

### QAM

Short for Quadrature Amplitude Modulation. Combination of ASK and PSK. Logical extension of QPSK. Sends 2 different signals simultaneously on same carrier frequency, phase shifted. Each carrier is ASK modulated.

Used on asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL).
